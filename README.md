# Task Management Application

This is a full-stack Task Management application built with:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + TypeORM
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication

## Features
- User registration and login
- JWT authentication for secure access
- Task management: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)
- User-specific tasks (Each user sees only their own tasks)
- Logout functionality
- Modern UI design

# Setup Instructions

## 1. Clone the Forked Repository

## 2. Setup the Backend
- Navigate to the backend folder:`cd backend`
- nstall dependencies:`npm install`
- Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
```JavaScript
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=taskdb
```
- Run database migrations:
`npx typeorm migration:run -d dist/ormconfig.js`
- Start the backend server:
`npm run dev`

The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 3. Setup the Frontend
- Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd ../frontend`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:
`VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`
- Start the frontend server:
`npm run dev`

The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

# Notes
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally and the credentials in `.env` are correct
- If npx typeorm migration:run fails, ensure the dist/migrations/ folder exists
- Use Postman or cURL to manually test API endpoints
- If any error occurs, check server logs (backend) or browser console (frontend)
